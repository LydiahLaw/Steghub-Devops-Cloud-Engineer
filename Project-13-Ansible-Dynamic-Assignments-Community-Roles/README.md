## Project Overview

This project builds upon previous Ansible configurations by introducing **dynamic assignments** and leveraging **community roles** from Ansible Galaxy. The goal is to create a flexible, environment-specific infrastructure configuration system that can manage multiple environments (Dev, Staging, UAT, Production) with minimal code duplication.

**Key Objectives:**
- Implement dynamic variable assignments using the `include` module
- Utilize production-ready community roles for MySQL and Load Balancers
- Configure conditional role execution based on environment variables
- Manage multi-environment infrastructure efficiently

---

## Understanding Key Concepts

### Static vs Dynamic Assignments

**Static Assignments (`import`):**
- All statements are pre-processed at **parse time** (when Ansible reads the playbook)
- Changes made during execution are **not** considered
- More reliable and easier to debug
- Best for: Playbooks with stable, unchanging configurations

**Dynamic Assignments (`include`):**
- Statements are processed during **execution time**
- Changes encountered during execution **are** applied
- More flexible but harder to debug
- Best for: Environment-specific variables that change frequently

**Analogy:**
- **Static** = A printed book (fixed content)
- **Dynamic** = A tablet displaying content based on your selections (flexible content)

### Why Use Community Roles?

Instead of writing complex configurations from scratch (e.g., 100+ lines for MySQL setup), we leverage:
- **Battle-tested** roles maintained by the community
- **Multi-distribution** support (Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, etc.)
- **Production-ready** code with best practices
- **Time-saving** - focus on business logic, not infrastructure boilerplate

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

**1.1 Start Your EC2 Instances**

Navigate to AWS Console and start all required instances (they must be running for Ansible to connect).

**1.2 SSH into Jenkins-Ansible Server**

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ubuntu@<Jenkins-Ansible-Public-IP>
```

**1.3 Configure SSH Agent**

Allow Ansible to use your SSH key to connect to target servers:

```bash
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add ~/.ssh/your-key.pem
```

Verify the key was added:

```bash
ssh-add -l
```

**Screenshot:** *SSH agent confirmation showing key fingerprint*

---

### Step 2: Create Dynamic Assignments Structure

**2.1 Create New Git Branch**

Navigate to your ansible configuration directory and create a feature branch:

```bash
cd ~/ansible-config-mgt
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b dynamic-assignments
```

This creates an isolated branch for development without affecting the main codebase.

**2.2 Create Directory Structure**

```bash
# Create dynamic-assignments folder for dynamic playbooks
mkdir -p dynamic-assignments

# Create env-vars folder for environment-specific variables
mkdir -p env-vars

# Create necessary files
touch dynamic-assignments/env-vars.yml
touch env-vars/dev.yml
touch env-vars/stage.yml
touch env-vars/uat.yml
touch env-vars/prod.yml
```

**2.3 Configure Dynamic Variable Loader**

Edit the dynamic variable loader file:

```bash
nano dynamic-assignments/env-vars.yml
```

Add the following content:

```yaml
---
- name: Collate variables from environment specific file, if it exists
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Looping through list of available files
      include_vars: "{{ item }}"
      with_first_found:
        - files:
            - dev.yml
            - stage.yml
            - prod.yml
            - uat.yml
          paths:
            - "{{ playbook_dir }}/../env-vars"
      tags:
        - always
```

**What this does:**
- `include_vars`: Dynamically loads variables from YAML files
- `with_first_found`: Searches through the file list and uses the first match
- `{{ playbook_dir }}`: Special variable that resolves to the playbook's directory
- `tags: always`: Ensures this task runs regardless of tag filtering

**Screenshot:** *env-vars.yml file content*

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

**3.1 Setup UAT Environment Variables**

Edit the UAT environment variable file:

```bash
nano env-vars/uat.yml
```

Add environment-specific configurations:

```yaml
---
# Load Balancer Selection
enable_nginx_lb: true
enable_apache_lb: false
load_balancer_is_required: true

# Environment Identifier
environment: uat
```

**What this configures:**
- Enables Nginx load balancer for UAT
- Disables Apache (we can only use one at a time)
- Marks load balancer as required for this environment
- Sets environment identifier for logging/tracking

**Screenshot:** *uat.yml configuration*

Repeat similar configurations for `dev.yml`, `stage.yml`, and `prod.yml` with environment-specific values.

---

### Step 4: Install MySQL Community Role

**4.1 Navigate to Roles Directory**

```bash
cd ~/ansible-config-mgt
mkdir -p roles
cd roles
```

**4.2 Install MySQL Role from Ansible Galaxy**

Ansible Galaxy is a repository of pre-built roles. We'll download the MySQL role:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.mysql
```

This downloads a production-ready MySQL role that handles:
- Package installation
- Service management
- Database creation
- User management
- Security configurations

**4.3 Rename for Consistency**

```bash
mv geerlingguy.mysql mysql
```

We rename it to `mysql` for cleaner, more intuitive references in our playbooks.

**4.4 Review Role Documentation**

```bash
cd mysql
cat README.md
```

Read through the available variables and configuration options.

**4.5 Configure MySQL for Tooling Application**

Edit the role's default variables:

```bash
nano defaults/main.yml
```

Add your database configurations:

```yaml
# MySQL Root Password
mysql_root_password: "secure_root_password_here"

# Databases to Create
mysql_databases:
  - name: tooling
    encoding: utf8mb4
    collation: utf8mb4_general_ci

# Database Users
mysql_users:
  - name: webaccess
    host: "172.31.%"  # Allow access from VPC subnet
    password: "secure_user_password"
    priv: "tooling.*:ALL"
```

**Configuration Explanation:**
- `mysql_root_password`: Administrator password for MySQL
- `mysql_databases`: List of databases to create automatically
- `mysql_users`: Application users with specific permissions
- `host: "172.31.%"`: Allows connections from any IP in the 172.31.x.x subnet (your VPC)

**Screenshot:** *MySQL role configuration*

---

### Step 5: Setup Load Balancer Roles

**5.1 Install Nginx Role**

```bash
cd ~/ansible-config-mgt/roles
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.nginx
mv geerlingguy.nginx nginx
```

**5.2 Install Apache Role**

```bash
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache
mv geerlingguy.apache apache
```

**5.3 Configure Nginx Role Defaults**

```bash
nano nginx/defaults/main.yml
```

Add at the top of the file:

```yaml
# Control Variables
enable_nginx_lb: false
load_balancer_is_required: false
```

**5.4 Configure Apache Role Defaults**

```bash
nano apache/defaults/main.yml
```

Add at the top:

```yaml
# Control Variables
enable_apache_lb: false
load_balancer_is_required: false
```

**Why set to false by default?**
- Provides explicit control over which load balancer is active
- Prevents accidental deployment of both load balancers
- Allows environment-specific override via `env-vars/` files

**Screenshot:** *Load balancer role defaults*

---

### Step 6: Configure Conditional Load Balancing

**6.1 Create Load Balancer Assignment File**

```bash
nano static-assignments/loadbalancers.yml
```

Add conditional role execution:

```yaml
---
- hosts: lb
  become: yes
  roles:
    - { role: nginx, when: enable_nginx_lb and load_balancer_is_required }
    - { role: apache, when: enable_apache_lb and load_balancer_is_required }
```

**Understanding the `when` Conditions:**
- `role: nginx`: Specifies which role to execute
- `when: enable_nginx_lb and load_balancer_is_required`: Both conditions must be `true`
  - Only runs if Nginx is explicitly enabled
  - Only runs if a load balancer is required for this environment
- The same logic applies to Apache

This prevents both load balancers from running simultaneously.

**Screenshot:** *loadbalancers.yml content*

---

### Step 7: Update Main Playbook

**7.1 Configure Ansible Settings**

```bash
nano ansible.cfg
```

Ensure it contains:

```ini
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
roles_path = /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/roles
inventory = /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/inventory
```

**Configuration Breakdown:**
- `host_key_checking = False`: Disables SSH host key verification (for dynamic environments)
- `roles_path`: Tells Ansible where to find roles
- `inventory`: Default inventory directory

**7.2 Update Site Playbook**

```bash
nano playbooks/site.yml
```

Replace with:

```yaml
---
# Include environment-specific variables dynamically
- hosts: all
  name: Include dynamic variables 
  tasks:
    - include: ../dynamic-assignments/env-vars.yml
      tags:
        - always

# Import common configurations (packages, users, etc.)
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml 

# Configure web servers
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/webservers.yml

# Configure load balancers (conditional)
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/loadbalancers.yml
  when: load_balancer_is_required
```

**Playbook Flow Explanation:**
1. **First play**: Loads environment-specific variables for all hosts
2. **Second play**: Applies common configurations to all servers
3. **Third play**: Configures web servers with application code
4. **Fourth play**: Sets up load balancer (only if required by environment)

**Screenshot:** *Complete site.yml playbook*

---

### Step 8: Deploy to UAT Environment

**8.1 Setup UAT Inventory**

```bash
nano inventory/uat
```

Add your UAT server details (using private IPs if running from same VPC):

```ini
[webservers]
172.31.79.75 ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/tooling.pem
172.31.66.68 ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/tooling.pem

[lb]
172.31.23.171 ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/tooling.pem

[db]
172.31.22.112 ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/tooling.pem
```

**Inventory Breakdown:**
- `[webservers]`: Group containing web application servers
- `[lb]`: Load balancer server (Ubuntu-based)
- `[db]`: Database server for MySQL
- `ansible_ssh_user`: User account for SSH connection
- `ansible_ssh_private_key_file`: Path to SSH private key

**Important:** Use **private IPs** when running Ansible from a server in the same VPC (faster, more secure).

**Screenshot:** *UAT inventory file*

**8.2 Commit Changes to GitHub**

```bash
cd ~/ansible-config-mgt
git add .
git commit -m "Add dynamic assignments and community roles for UAT"
git push --set-upstream origin dynamic-assignments
```

**8.3 Create Pull Request and Merge**

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Compare & pull request" for the `dynamic-assignments` branch
3. Review changes in the Files changed tab
4. Click "Create pull request"
5. Add description: "Implements dynamic assignments and community roles"
6. Merge pull request to `main` branch

**Screenshot:** *GitHub Pull Request*

**8.4 Pull Latest Changes**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

---

## Testing and Validation

**Step 1: Test Inventory Connectivity**

Verify Ansible can reach all UAT servers:

```bash
ansible all -i inventory/uat -m ping
```

**Expected Output:**
```
172.31.79.75 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
172.31.66.68 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
...
```

**Screenshot:** *Successful ping test*

**Step 2: Run Playbook in Check Mode**

Test without making changes (dry-run):

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/uat playbooks/site.yml --check
```

This shows what *would* change without actually applying changes.

**Step 3: Execute Full Deployment**

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/uat playbooks/site.yml
```

**What happens during execution:**
1. Loads UAT-specific variables (`env-vars/uat.yml`)
2. Applies common configurations to all servers
3. Installs and configures MySQL on database server
4. Configures web servers with application
5. Installs and configures Nginx load balancer (since `enable_nginx_lb: true`)

**Screenshot:** *Playbook execution output*

**Step 4: Verify Nginx Load Balancer**

SSH into the load balancer server:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/tooling.pem ubuntu@172.31.23.171
```

Check Nginx status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

**Expected:** Service should be active (running)

**Screenshot:** *Nginx service status*

**Step 5: Test Load Balancer Switching**

To switch from Nginx to Apache, edit the UAT variables:

```bash
nano env-vars/uat.yml
```

Change to:

```yaml
enable_nginx_lb: false
enable_apache_lb: true
load_balancer_is_required: true
```

Re-run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/uat playbooks/site.yml
```

Ansible will:
1. Stop and remove Nginx
2. Install and configure Apache
3. Start Apache service

**Screenshot:** *Apache installation output*

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid characters were found in group names"

**Problem:** Hyphens in inventory group names (e.g., `[uat-webservers]`)

**Solution:** Use underscores instead:
```ini
# Change from:
[uat-webservers]

# To:
[uat_webservers]
# OR simply:
[webservers]
```

---

### Issue: "Unable to retrieve file contents - webservers.yml"

**Problem:** File doesn't exist or has wrong name

**Solution:** Check existing files and rename:
```bash
ls static-assignments/
mv uat-webservers.yml webservers.yml
```

---

### Issue: "Role 'webserver' was not found"

**Problem:** Ansible can't locate the roles directory

**Solution:** Update `ansible.cfg`:
```ini
[defaults]
roles_path = /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/roles
```

---

### Issue: Connection timeout to target servers

**Problem:** SSH connectivity issues

**Solution:**
1. Verify instances are running in AWS Console
2. Check security groups allow SSH (port 22) from Jenkins-Ansible server
3. Test manual SSH: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/tooling.pem ec2-user@172.31.x.x`
4. Verify SSH agent has key loaded: `ssh-add -l`

---
